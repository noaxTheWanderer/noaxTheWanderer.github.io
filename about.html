<h1>Why this blog!?</h1>

<p>Life is full of adventures, at times I wish I had a blog so I could share my 
experiences with you, and at times, I wish I had no blog since most of the 
questions I have, people had experienced them and hence, I never new why it was 
useful. But anyway this time, I said I would start my own blog.</p>
<p><b>The internet is everything</b>, using <a 
href="http://google.com">Google</a> search, I can find answers to all of my 
questions. Mostly <a href="http://stackexchange.com" taget="_blank" 
>stackexchange</a> and related sites is where I am likely to be most of the 
times.</p>
