Two articles had been posted on my pages since I launched it in May. After launching it, I made a promise to myself, that is to post at least an article every month..

Though I had started writing the article for June, but I really had to put it aside and concentrate on another thing that I had wanted to share with you all..

About two years ago, I started studying taking online courses at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).. I think I enrolled for like four courses, and I never managed to finish any of them.

So earlier in May, I found out [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) would be offering a course: **[Developing Innovative Ideas for New Companies: The First Step in Entrepreneurship](https://www.coursera.org/course/innovativeideas)**.

###Two things motivated me:
*  **I had never participated in a full class in Entrepreneurship, hence this was my golden opportunity.**
*  **I enjoy learning something new and I believed it would bring some postive thoughts..**

So I enrolled to the course and waited for the course to start. The first two weeks were simple and mostly introductory stuffs. But then after the second week, things begun getting tough. The lecturer covered so much more topics and subjects, in some lecturer dug dipper and in others, not so much. So the whole responsibility fell back on my shoulders to cover up. Hence, more reading was required from myside.

While the course was going on, I realized something which I had thought of before at some point in my life.. Realizing your personal problems/ weakness is a key to succeed further if you work on your problems/ weakness. The course helped to clear and teach me a lot of other things.

The course was pretty intense and time consuming since, and by participating on discussion forums will ensure that one gets the best out of the course.

In the end, I did manage to finish the course with distinction. For me, it was a great achieve since it is the first time I actually participated in a class about Entrepreneurship.

## My advice for you in case you try to learn from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) next time:

### Take fewer courses:

>The first time, when I learned about [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), I wanted to try and learn so much time at same time. I took about four courses in Programming since I really wanted to improve my programming skills and learn about other programming languages. It was a bad ideas since, I was trying to play-catch most of the times buy trying to complete one assignment after another.. In the end the assignments go to much and I could NO longer put my best effort.
>Also, participating on the forum is a key to learn because then you can really see which kind of obstacles are other students experiencing and you can learn from it.

### Commitment..

> It is important to think the online class you are taking is your real class and hence, do NOT cheat.

### Open minded..

> There are hundreds of students participating in these courses, hence, be ready to hear new things that you have never heard of before..

### Internet as a learning tool..

>After participating on this course, then I started searching from YouTube about different tutorials on specific subjects and I realized that a lot of these things are already available..

### Journey as entrepreneur..

> As an Entrepreneur, I realized the more I learn and participate in these kinds of courses and even events, I will be opening more doors..

So next time, when I want to learn something new, I will simply start to check on YouTube then move to the online courses.
