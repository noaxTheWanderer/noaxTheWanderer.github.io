# Silent Agust: The FIFTH DISCIPLINE

Lately, I have been trying to build a culture of reading. So far my goal has been to read at least one book a month. I have kept my goal and it feels very good. The more I read, the more I learn, the more I grow.

Last month, August, I spent most of my time reading about a very interesting book called: [ The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of The Learning Organization](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization-ebook/dp/B000SEIFKK).

The first time, I heard about the book was some few years ago and I have been longing to read about *The Fifth Discipline*.

The main reason why I really wanted to read the book was to understand one particular matter: Why is it hard to practice learning ( knowledge transfer) in an organization!?
After more than a month of reading, I am happy to say that the book: The Fifth Discipline really answered my question thoroughly and gave extra knowledge on how to build one, a learning organization.

In part 1 of the book, author has a topic entitled: "Does your organization have a Learning Disability!?" The author discusses about seven (7) which would indicate that your organization has a learning disability. These are:

> * I AM MY POSITION
> * THE ENEMY IS OUT THERE
> * THE ILLUSION OF TAKING CHARGE
> * THE FIXATION OF EVENTS
> * THE PARABLE OF THE BOILED FROG
> * THE DELUSION OF LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE

If you grab a copy of the book and read about the above mentioned topic, then you will clearly understand what the author is trying to achieve in the book and if the book is relevant to you at all.

These things really had an effect on me and made me anxious to continue reading the book.
At work, most of the times we try to find a reason to get out of the problem ( The Fixation of Events) and yet we try to keep our work to ourselves ( I Am My Position).
The result is a crippled organization where people are **NOT able to grow professionally** and **can not work with other people**, which is a sign for disaster in the future.

Many times, I never think of the future.. 

Lately, I have trying to build a product and eventually start a company in the near future.. When I read about this book it really changed my way of think about how approach things. If I make a product, should I make it alone or in a team!? If I make it alone, it would not last, if I make it a team, how do i make it!? The first question I should have asked is: What is my vision!? What is my goal!? I am positive the two questions will help me shape my future and the company's future.
Before I grow, I realized I have to create a culture of a learning organization in order to fulfill my dream.

In Part 3, the author writes about:

> * Personal Mastery,
> * Mental Models, 
> * Shared Vision and 
> * Team Learning 

Personally, I agree that these essential for building a successful future.

I am simply a believer.. 

* Personal Mastery will give your workers so many advantages and making their life at work easy. If people are able to perform their work easily then it means they will enjoy their work. Also, it means shorter time to get things done.
* Mental models simply refer to the way we think systematically..
* A shared vision simply means people in the organization are ready to follow and are happy with the end results..
* Team learning simply means working together and understanding how your parts affect each other leads to better productivity.
* System Thinking means to let people in your organization think in another way and like traditional thinkers


Why i recommend the book!?
I have never had the opportunity to lead and grow a big organization but if I ever get a chance to do that I would commit to practice the ideas given in this book.
If you are a leader who cares the well-being of your employees/ co-workers this book is definetely must read because it will help show the side.
The book of gives out detailed examples of real organization which are enjoying the benefits of a learning organization. There are several examples which try to cover different organization and in different levels.

I am positive I am going to be reading this book in the next two or three years from now just to remind myself of why it is important to have "A Learning Organization"


I tried to gather some few quotes from the book and hope I can inspire you to get a copy too.


*It can truly be said that nothing happens until there is vision. But it is equally true that a vision with no underlying sense of purpose, no calling, is just a good idea-all. "sounds and fury, signifying nothing"* 

*A mistake is an event, the full benefit of which has not yet been turned to your advantage.*

*Vision paints the picture of what we want to create. Systems thinking reveals how we have created what we currently have.*
