Normally, every year I return to Tanzania for my holidays. Most of the times, I 
get roughly about thirty (30) days for holidays.
During the holidays, I am in so much pressure of trying to accomplish things 
which would normally take about three-six months depend on how fast you are..
It is the worst time for me because I try do so many things at once: visit 
family members, meet old classmates, explore around Tanzania, check business, 
start new business, register new company.. and so much more...

Last year 2013, I decided to quit my work after working in Finland for nearly 
10 years, I made up my mind to return to Tanzania to engage on my own 
businesses..

I did NOT want to start my business upon my return because I new it would be a 
mistake since I am out of touch with everything about Tanzania.

With  goal focus and locked in my mind, I decided to take sometime to study my 
new environment.

While discussing with people about doing business in Tanzania, the discussions 
are full of negative things majority of the times. However, this time, the 
focus was more on the positive things since negative things would bring 
discouragements and fustrations.

I visited so many places and businesses as well.. I realized one thing:

# "A TRANSFORMED SOCIETY"


People ( including business) have changed so much and as I went on I realized 
that my mind was still in the early 2000 when I moved to Finland. And of 
course, there are those that I still stuck in the 1990, I can NOT ignore them.

But one thing which I could NOT stop seeing is the number of potential 
opportunities which were present and yet nobody was utilizing them.

# "Motherland full of potentials"

In fact, the inspiration to start this blog, I got it from there after 
realizing I do NOT even have a blog.. __I was old fashioned__ In fact, the 
primary goal was *to share "My Journey as an Entrepreneur"* while the other 
reason, *a promise to my friend who is eager about similar things, Halifa 
Mjengwa..*

There is a lot of potential in Tanzania, especially away from Dar Es Salaam. 
People in the interior of Tanzania are hungry for change, they would like to be 
advanced and hence they are ready to get the necessary tools to make them feel 
advanced. I was surprised to see a traditional house in Tanzania has a solar 
panel and the these old couples used it to listen to radio, charge their phones 
and lights. I asked him how much it costed them to purchase the solar panel, 
the old couples mentioned a five figure digit.. But it helps them a lot.. I 
asked them how did they finance that large sum of money and their response was 
.. SAVINGS.. **Looking at this one simple idea, I could think of a 
micro-lending company to help them finance for these kinds of equipments.**<br 
/>
*Learning: simple life*. 

Another visit took me to Ruvu areas, quite near to Dar Es Salaam, where I met 
a farmer who is now a pensioner, Mzee Malugu. After retiring, he bought about 
four acres of land near Ruvu area then he started a small farm and also fish 
pond. Since two years of being in pension, he told me *he regrets* he had never 
retired earlier because now he earns four times more he used to earn in a week. 
The thing which facinated me is that he has very little knowledge of the tools 
and equipments which can help him improve his agricultural produce. But last 
year, he spent nearly TShs 5.000.000/ to buy a drip irrigation system to 
irrigate his one acre of onions. Marvelous..!!<br />
*Learning: Vision | Tools of Productivity*

Later on, I visited Ifakara and Kilosa on the way to Uduzungwa National Park. 

At Uduzungwa we discovered one fabulous hotel build on the foot hills of 
Uduzungwa mountains. However, the hotel turned out to be too expensive and had 
to seek accomodation at other places. The next day we showed up for breakfast, 
and tried to know more about this amazing hotel. After long discussion with 
Manager and Marketing Manager, we learned that the hotel gets less than 20 
customers a week. I was shocked and I could NOT believe my ears.. But it was 
the truth.. We tried getting some information on how they do their market, and 
we learned that they still use the word of mouth.. Not so much internet.. 
SUPRISED WHY NO VISITORS!!<br />
*Learning: Marketing in modern ways!! Great Vision and Good Plan for business*

After that, I turned to Dar Es Salaam on the Tech Hubs of KINU and COSTECH. 
Well, they are doing great things.. At KINU, I met with [Hamis 
Kibonde](http://softlink.co.tz/), who works at SoftLink Company and he showed 
some great stuffs. And also we had long discussion regarding the challenges 
facing small business and different kinds of challenges they face to sell their 
software solutions. At COSTECH, also many stuffs are still in progress and I 
hope upon my next return, I will be able to see more products. I still have my 
eyes on **[Niafikra](http://niafikra.com)** because these guys are doing some 
real cool awesome stuffs in the web sphere like their product 
**[nihisa.com](http://www.niafikra.com)**
*Learning: Software for Service Sectors*

In short, I learned so much but I can try to point some few stuffs..

### Never Underestimate
> Many people in Tanzania now adays are explorers, and hence do NOT be 
surprised people mentioning something that you thought was way advanced. I 
thought e-invoicing is NOT available in Tanzania, but actually people proved me 
wrong and they are using e-invoices since three years ago. Also, never 
understand the strength of your competitors, thinking that you are offering a 
better service than them, because they are also learning from you when you 
enter their business market.

### Be Patience
> Rome was NOT built overnight.

### Focus
> I have NO idea why I wrote this but I found out one problem with many people 
in Tanzania, they try to do so much in their businesses. But in a way I do 
understand because you do get the same customers every month and hence you have 
to offer a wide range of services to be able to survive in business. But I also 
think if you offer better service, there will be a lot of returning customers 
and hence, try to focus.

### In Search of New Experiences
> People in Tanzania are really looking for new experiences.. A Hotel Manager, 
an old friend of mine who wanted a very attractive website for the hotels. He 
pointed out some of the websites which he had in mind that he would prefer for 
the new hotel website.

### Ready to learn
> Like any other society in the world, Tanzanian society is dynamic. People 
have come up with new ways of making payments such as Max-Malipo and many 
others trying to compete with M-Pesa. Learning new things will give you an 
advantage into creating better competing solutions hence guarantees chances of 
your success.

### Seeking Business Ideas
> There are so many consultants in Tanzania and most of them are in IT sector, 
but I have not met any Public Relations, Team trainers ( meaning Couches who 
will help build teams), Marketing especially online for leisure services, 
business automation, online banking ( mobile banking is threat), equipments 
lending ( different kinds NOT only concrete mixtures but a variety)

### Enough capital
> This does NOT mean money only.. It also means knowledge about the domain you 
are trying to get into business. Your solution should be advanced or if it is a 
service then it should be super organized.


### Existing Market
> If you have no new idea and try to compete in the same space as many other 
local businesses, then simply be different with a better product/ service.

__Tanzania is transformed, and people really know the value of their money.. So 
get ready for facing tough challenges!!__


## Potential is huge!!

# ALL THE BEST IN YOUR ENDEAVOURS!!
